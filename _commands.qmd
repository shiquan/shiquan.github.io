### parse

The parse tool is specifically designed to convert FASTQ files into the extended FASTQ+ format. It utilizes the -rule option to define the library structure, accommodating various sequencing setups. For ease of use, this tool has included predefined common library structures in the release; these can be applied using the -x option. This tool is optimized for speed and supports the correction of barcodes that have up to one mismatch.

```         
# Parse cell barcode and UMI string from raw FASTQ.

$ PISA parse -rule CB,R1:1-10,whitelist.txt,CB,1;R1,R1:11-60;R2,R2 -report fastq.csv lane1_1.fq.gz,lane02_1.fq.gz lane1_2.fq.gz,lane2_2.fq.gz

Options :
 -1       [fastq]   Read 1 output.
 -2       [fastq]   Read 2 output.
 -rule    [STRING]  Read structure in line. See Notice.
 -p                 Read 1 and read 2 interleaved in the input file.
 -q       [INT]     Drop reads if average sequencing quality below this value.
 -dropN             Drop reads if N base in sequence or barcode.
 -report  [csv]     Summary report.
 -t       [INT]     Threads. [4]
 -order             Keep input order.
 -x                 Predefined code for specific library.
          * C4      Library structure for DNBelab C4 RNA kit v1.
Notice :
 * -rule accept tag rule STRING to parse input fastq following format "TAG,location,whitelist,corrected TAG,allow mismatch".
   For each tag rule, location part should be format like R[12]:start-end. Both start and end location start from 1.
   TAG and locaion parts are mandatory, and whitelist, corrected TAG and mismatch are optional.
   Futhermore, multiply tags seperated by ';'. In location part, R1 stands for raw read 1, R2 stands for raw read 2.
   In tag part, R1 stands for output read 1 while R2 stands for output read 2. Here are some examples.

$ PISA parse -rule 'CR,R1:1-18,barcodes.txt,CB,1;UR,R1:19-30;R1,R2:1-100' -1 read_1.fq raw_read_1.fq raw_read_2.fq

# CR,R1:1-18,barcodes.txt,CB,1  - CR tag start from 1 to 18 in read 1, and barcodes.txt are barcode whitelist,
#   each barcode per line. Cell barcode will be corrected while hamming distance <= 1.
#   Corrected cell barcode tag is CB. 
# UR,R1:19-30 - UR tag start from 19-30 in read 1.
# R1,R2:1-100 - Sequence from 1 to 100 in read 2 output to read 1 file. 

$ PISA parse -rule 'CR,R1:1-10,bc1.txt,CB,1;CR,R1:11-20,bc2.txt,CB,1;R1,R2:1-100' -1 read_1.fq raw_read_1.fq raw_read_2.fq

# CR,R1:1-10,bc1.txt,CB,1;CR,R1:11-20,bc2.txt,CB,1 - This cell barcode consist of two segments, first segment start
#   from 1 to 10 in read 1, and whitelist is bc1.txt, and second segment start from 11 to 20, and whitelist is bc2.txt.
#   These two segments will be combined after correction, because the corrected tag are the same.
```

Option -report can specify a quality control report in CSV format. Here is the explanation of each term in this file.

### fsort

The fsort tool is engineered to order FASTQ+ records based on specified tags, which can be defined using the -tags option. This tool efficiently handles file sorting: for files smaller than 1 gigabyte, it performs the sort directly. However, for larger FASTQ files, where caching the entire file in memory is impractical, fsort employs a different strategy. It splits the large file into smaller segments, sorts each segment individually, and then merges the sorted segments. This method ensures efficient handling of large datasets while maintaining the integrity and order of the FASTQ+ records.

```         
# Sort reads by tags.

$ PISA fsort -tags CB,UR -list cell_barcodes_top10K.txt -@ 5 -o sorted.fq.gz in.fq

Options:
 -tags    [TAGS]     Tags, such as CB,UR. Order of these tags is sensitive.
 -@       [INT]      Threads to compress file.
 -o       [fq.gz]    bgzipped output fastq file.
 -m       [mem]      Memory per thread. [1G]
 -p                  Input fastq is smart pairing.
 -T       [prefix]   Write temporary files to PREFIX.nnnn.tmp
```

### stream

The stream tool is designed as a framework to process FASTQ+ files, where each FASTQ+ block—defined by having identical tags and grouped together in the file—is handled individually. The -script option allows users to specify a custom bash script that processes each block. This user-defined script reads a ‘small’ FASTQ+ file, generating FASTQ or FASTA output that is then sent to stdout. The stream tool captures this output via a pipe and updates the tags to ensure that each block of reads retains its original tags. Finally, it consolidates all outputs into a single file. In essence, this tool efficiently divides and processes each FASTQ+ block through a user-defined method, then seamlessly merges the results.

```         
# Perform user-defined script for each FASTQ+ block.

$ PISA stream -script run.sh reads.fq.gz

Options :
 -tags    [TAGS]     Tags to define read blocks.
 -script  [FILE]     User defined bash script, process $FQ and generate results to stdout.
 -min     [INT]      Mininal reads per block to process.  [2]
 -keep               Output unprocessed FASTQ+ records.
 -fa                 Stream FASTQ output instead of FASTQ.
 -tmpdir
 -t                  Threads.
 -o       [FILE]     Path to output file.
 -nw                 Disable warning messages.
```

#### Write a script for PISA stream

The PISA stream tool generates a temporary file named \_block.fq for each block of reads, storing this file in a designated temporary directory. The path to this file is set in the environment variable \${FQ} for accessibility by subprocesses. Additionally, to ensure the uniqueness of each block, an alias named the ‘unique block index’ is exported to the environment as \${UBI}.

The following example script demonstrates how to convert FASTQ+ to FASTA and rename the sequence ID. It is crucial for users to ensure that the script’s final output (either FASTQ+ or FASTA) is directed to stdout. All other script steps should avoid producing output to stdout or stderr, except for the last step. This precaution is necessary because PISA captures the script’s output through a pipe, and any unintended characters could disrupt the data format. Scripts can be written in a bash file or specified inline within the command.

::: framed
```         
$ cat run.sh
seqtk rename ${FQ} > test.fa; seqtk rename test.fa ${UBI}
```
:::

### addtags

The addtags tool is designed to put the new tags or update tags for FASTQ+ or BAM files.

```         
# Just add tags to reads.

$ PISA addtags -str CB:Z:CELL1,LB:Z:PoII2 -o out.bam in.bam
$ PISA addtags -str CB:Z:CELL1,LB:Z:PoII2 -o out.fastq in.fastq

Options:
-o    [FILE]    Output file, bam or fastq, depends on input format
-str  [string]  TAGs.
-@    [INT]     Threads to pack file.
-mapq [INT]     Mapping quality score to filter mapped reads.
```

### sam2bam

After alignment, the sequence ID from the FASTQ+ records is retained in the RNAME field of the SAM file. Given that the RNAME field is limited to 254 characters, we also restrict the sequence ID and any optional tag fields in FASTQ+ to this length to ensure compatibility. The sam2bam tool processes these details by parsing the tags from the RNAME and appending them to the end of the SAM optional fields.

```         
# Parse FASTQ+ read name and convert SAM to BAM.

$ PISA sam2bam -report alignment.csv -@ 5 -adjust-mapq -gtf genes.gtf -o aln.bam in.sam[.gz]

Options :
 -o       [BAM]       Output file [stdout].
 -t       [INT]       Work threads.
 -mito    [string]    Mitochondria name. Used to stat ratio of mitochondria reads.
 -maln    [BAM]       Export mitochondria reads into this file instead of standard output file.
 -@       [INT]       Threads to compress bam file.
 -report  [csv]       Alignment report.

Note :
* Reads map to multiple loci usually be marked as low quality and filtered at downstream analysis.
  But for RNAseq library, if reads map to an exonic locus but also align to 1 or more non-exonic loci,
  the exonic locus can be prioritized as primary alignments, and mapping quality adjusts to 255. Tag
  MM:i:1 will also be added for this record. Following options used to adjust mapping quality.
* Input SAM need be sorted by read name, and aligner should output all hits of a read in this SAM.
 -adjust-mapq         Enable adjusts mapping quality score.
 -gtf     [GTF]       GTF annotation file. This file is required to check the exonic regions.
 -qual    [255]       Updated quality score.
```

Option -t is to set the threads to parse the SAM records. The -\@ option is to set the threads to compress alignments in BGZF format. The default compress level of BGZF is 6 in the htslib, but here PISA has reset this value to 2 to decrease the CPU times. It's not a good design to have both -t and -\@, but will require a lot work to redesign the multithreads strategy, I have put this work in my todo list.

Option -report can specify a quality control report in CSV format. Here is the explanation of each term in this file.

| Mitochondria ratio | Ratio of reads mapped to chromosome mitochondria. The default mito name is "chrM", user should change it by -mito option if reference is different. Otherwise this value will always be 0. |

#### MapQ adjust method

For RNA libraries, if a read from cDNA maps to an exonic locus but also maps to one or more non-exonic regions, the exonic locus can be prioritized as primary alignments, and mapping quality adjusts to 255. In the below records below, read DP8400008965TLL1C001R0102043364 mapped to three loci, and the aligner random pick one as the primary alignment and others as secondary. Each of these alignments has low mapping quality (MAPQ == 2, is usually filtered at downstream analysis). Our adjustment method will check if only one of these alignments overlaps with exonic regions. In our example, the last alignment overlapped with gene EEF1A1, and the other two hit intergenic regions. After adjustment, the last record has been flagged as a primary hit, and the mapping quality adjusted to 255, and other alignments of the same read are updated as secondary, MAPQ adjust to 0. MM:i:1 tag also is added to the primary record after adjustment. Option -adjust-mapq is reimplemented to mirror the 10X CellRanger's MAPQ adjustment method (<https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview#alignment>).

### rmdup

To effectively manage PCR duplication in single-cell experiments, it is essential to consider both cell and molecular barcodes. During the feature counting stage facilitated by PISA count, deduplication is efficiently handled by relying solely on unique UMIs. This reliance makes traditional PCR deduplication unnecessary for libraries that use UMIs. Nonetheless, producing a deduplicated BAM file remains beneficial for other analytical processes, such as variant calling, or simply to reduce file size.

The rmdup tool is specifically designed to remove duplicate reads that share identical barcodes, such as UMIs and cell barcodes. This selective deduplication approach ensures that only truly redundant data is removed, thus preserving the integrity and completeness of the dataset for comprehensive downstream analyses.

```         
# Deduplicate PCR reads with same barcodes.

$ PISA rmdup -tags CB,UR -o rmdup.bam in.bam

Options :
   -tags  [TAGS]       Barcode tags to group reads.
   -@     [INT]        Threads to unpack BAM.
   -o     [BAM]        Output bam.
   -q     [INT]        Map Quality Score cutoff.
   -k                  Keep duplicates, make flag instead of remove them.
   -nw                 Disable warnings.
```

In this version, PISA rmdup only supports single-end reads. For paired-end reads, such as scATAC data, PCR deduplication can be performed by the PISA bam2frag tool.

### pick

The PISA pick tool is designed to select alignments with predefined tags and candidate values.

```         
$ PISA pick -tags CB,GN -list cell_barcodes.txt in.bam

Options :
 -tags    [TAGS]       Barcode tags.
 -list    [FILE]       Barcode white list, tag values in related column will be apply.
 -o       [BAM]        Output file.
 -q       [INT]        Map Quality Score cutoff.
 -@       [INT]        Threads to unpack BAM.
```

Depending on the number of tags specified by the user, the candidate list for tags can consist of either a single column or multiple columns. If multiple tags are specified but only one column is present in the list, the program will primarily compare the value of the first tag in the alignments with the list.

### anno

Connecting alignment results with genomic features is essential in single-cell data analysis. PISA categorizes features into three main types: gene annotation, functional regions, and genetic or sequence variations. For gene annotation, the PISA anno tool efficiently organizes all exons, transcripts, and genes from a GTF database into a sorted hierarchical tree structure.

Based on their alignment status, reads are then classified into one of nine distinct types, see illustrate below [Figure 1](#fig:fig01){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:fig01"}. This detailed categorization helps in accurately assessing the transcriptional landscape and understanding the complex genomic architecture within single-cell datasets.

![Figure 1: Read types.](anno_type.png){#fig:fig01 width="\\textwidth"}

```         

# annotate strand-specific reads
$ PISA anno -gtf genes.gtf -o anno.bam sorted.bam

# annotate non-strand-specific reads, for Smartseq or bulk RNAseq
$ PISA anno -ignore-strand -gtf genes.gtf -o anno.bam sorted.bam

# also label gene name for intronic reads, i.e. RNA velocity analysis
$ PISA anno -intron -gtf genes.gtf -o anno.bam sorted.bam

# annotate expressed peaks and genetic variants (both reference allele and alternative allele) 
$ PISA anno -bed peak.bed -vcf in.vcf.gz -vcf-ss -ref-alt -o anno.bam in.bam
```

Besides these annotation methods, PISA anno also supports a -chr-species method. This method requires a binding list for chromosome and related label relationships. The software will check the chromosome and add the related tag for each chromosome. This method, combined with PISA attrcnt can help to summarize the mixed two cell lines from different species.

```         
# A binding list is tab-separated two columns txt file.
$ cat binding_list.txt
GRCh38_chr1    Human
GRCh38_chr21   Human
mm10_chr21     Mouse

$ PISA anno -chr-species binding.txt -btag SP -o anno_species.bam sorted.bam

```

### corr

The diversity of UMIs of each gene in one cell is used to evaluate the gene expression level, but the error of UMI comes from sequencing or PCR may introduce bias. PISA corr is designed to correct the UMI or barcode sequence based on Hamming distance. In default, two groups of UMI from the same gene of one cell with Hamming distance equal to 1, will be considered to originate from the same transcript. The group with high frequency will be selected as a real one, and another one will be corrected to the high one.

Because PISA corr does not require a sorted BAM, this tool will first build a correction list by caching all the raw UMIs and barcodes and then correct them in memory. After these steps, this tool will reread the file and update these records by order. This design can avoid potential bias for the same gene from different chromosomes (i.e., the HLA genes in alternative locus). However, this design also required a lot of memory for a big BAM.

CellRanger also introduces an algorithm to correct reads with the same UMI of one cell but mapping to more than one gene (<https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview>). PISA implements this method but does not enable it in default. The -cr option can be used by users to enable this function. The reason for not enable it by default is PISA corr not only is used to correct UMIs, but also can be used to correct any other types of barcodes. The following example shows how to use PISA corr to correct cell barcodes for reads in the same gene.

```         
// Reads with same gene tag (GN) and UMI (UB) will be grouped and calculate the Hamming distance between each other. 
// Only if Hamming distance == 1 will be corrected.
PISA corr -tag CR -new-tag CB -tags-block GN,UB -o cell_barcode_corrected.bam in.bam
```

Full options of PISA corr list below.

```         
# Correct similar barcodes (hamming distance == 1).

$ PISA corr -tag UR -new-tag UB -tags-block CB,GN -@ 5 -o corr.bam in.bam

Options :
 -o        [BAM]       Output bam.
 -tag      [TAG]       Tag to correct.
 -new-tag  [TAG]       Create a new tag for corrected barcodes.
 -tags-block  [TAGS]   Tags to define read group. For example, if set to GN (gene), reads in the same gene will be grouped together.
 -cr                   Enable CellRanger like UMI correction method. See `Examples` for details.
 -e                    Maximal hamming distance to define similar barcode, default is 1.
 -@        [INT]       Thread to compress BAM file.


Examples :
 // Two groups of reads have same cell barcode (CB) and gene (GN) but their raw UMIs (UR) differ by only one base. The UMI of less 
 // supported is corrected to the UMI with higher support. UB save the checked or corrected UMI.
$ PISA corr -tag UR -new-tag UB -tags-block CB,GN in.bam -o corr.bam 

 // Same with above. Besides, if two or more groups of reads have same CB and UB but different GN, the GN with the most supporting reads
 // is kept for UMI counting, and the other read groups are discarded. In case of a tie for maximal read support, all read groups are
 // discarded, as the gene cannot be confidently assigned (Cell Ranger method).
$ PISA corr -cr -tag UR -new-tag UB -tags-block CB,GN in.bam -o corr.bam 
```

```

### count

The PISA count tool is designed to generate a counts matrix for various features or tags, traditionally outputting a gene-by-cell digit matrix. Starting with version 0.4, this tool now supports the MEX format output, which is highly recommended for use in downstream analyses due to its superior performance. It’s important to note that MEX format consists of three files, so you should use the -outdir option to specify the directory where the output files will be saved.

```         
# Count reads or fragments matrix for single-cell datasets.

$ PISA count -cb CB -anno-tag GN -umi UB -outdir exp aln.bam
$ PISA count [options] aln1.bam,aln2.bam
$ PISA count -cb RG -sample-list bam_files.txt -outdir exp
$ PISA count -tags Cx,Cy -anno-tag GN -umi UB -outdir exp -velo aln.bam

Options :
 -tags/-cb [TAGs]     A cell barcode tag or two tags of spatial coordinates for spatial data.
 -anno-tag [TAG]      Annotation tag, gene or peak.

 -ttype    [TYPE]     Region type used to count. Set `E,S` to count exon enclosed reads. Set `N,C` to count intron overlapped reads.
 -sample-list [FILE]  A list of bam files. Each path per line.

Options for Stereoseq:
 -stereoseq           Stereoseq pipeline pack UMI to hex string. Need set this option to decode UMIs.
 -spatial-bin [INT]   Bin size for spatial coordiate. Can be set if -tags specify spatial coordinates.[1]
 -dup                 Do NOT skip duplicate reads.

Notice :
 * Region type (RE), which label functional region reads mapped, is annotated by `PISA anno`. Optional -ttype can be set
   to one of region types(E/S/C/N) or combination to count reads mapped to these functional regions only.
 * If you want count from more than one bam file, there are two ways to set the parameter. By seperating bam files with ',' or by
   setting -sample-list option.
 * If -velo set, spliced and unspliced folders will be created at outdir.
```

#### For Smartseq user

PISA count also support counting gene expression from multiple bam files.

```         
$ PISA count -file-barcode             // use alias name for each bam file as cell barcode. If this flag is not set -cb must be specified.
-tags CB                   // Cell barcode
-sample-list bam_list.txt // bam file path and alias name
-outdir exp/ -anno-tag GN 

# The `-sample-list' specify multiply files, each BAM path per line.
```

#### Description of MEX file

The Market Exchange (MEX) format (<https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html>) is designed for representing the sparse matrix. The -outdir option specifies the output directory for one MEX fold. The MEX format consists of three files, one is cell barcodes, one is feature names (genes or peak names), and the third one defines the expression or signal values.

```

### bam2fq

PISA bam2fq is designed to convert alignment records to FATSQ+ records. Option -tags specify which tags will be kept in the FASTQ+. Full options list below.

```         
# Convert BAM into fastq.
$ PISA bam2fq -tags CB,UB,GN -o out.fq aln.bam

Options :
 -tags     [TAGS]     Export tags in read name.
 -f                   Filter records if specified tags not all exist.
 -fa                  Output fasta instead of fastq.
 -o        [fastq]    Output file.
 -@        [INT]      Threads to unpack BAM.
```

### bam2frag

The fragment file is a five columns tab-separated flat file which is designed for scATAC-seq. The first column is the chromosome name, the second column is the start location of this fragment (0 based), and the third column is the end position in 1 based of this fragment. The fourth column is the cell barcode of this fragment and the last column is how many duplicates of this fragment.

PISA bam2frag requires the input BAM file to be sorted by coordinate. This tool will check the cell barcode and the fragment position for each paired reads, duplicates in one cell will only keep one record, and the numeber of copies for this fragment will be updated in column four.

```         
# Convert sam record to fragment file.

$ PISA bam2frag -cb CB -list cell_barcodes.txt -o out.tsv.gz in.bam

Options:
 -o       [FILE]    Output file. This file will be bgzipped and indexed.
 -cb      [TAG]     Cell barcode tag.
 -list    [FILE]    Cell barcode white list.
 -q       [20]      Mapping quality score to filter reads.
 -isize   [2000]    Skip if insert size greater than this. [2KB]
 -bed     [BED]     Only convert fragments overlapped with target regions.
 -black-region [BED] Skip convert fragments overlapped with black regions.
 -stat    [FILE]    Transposition events per cell.
 -@       [4]       Thread to unpack and pack files.[4]
 -disable-offset    Disable Tn5 offset for each fragment.
```

### depth

PISA depth generates coverage information for each position of the predefined region(s). The significant difference between PISA depth and samtools depth (<http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-depth.html>) is that PISA depth use UMI rather than reads. Besides, PISA depth is strand sensitive, and can produce results for target cells.

```         
# Count coverage depth or unique UMIs for genome locations.

Usage : PISA depth [options] sorted.bam [region]

$ PISA depth -cb CB -umi UB -tags GN -region in.bed -o depth.tsv sorted.bam
$ PISA depth -cb CB -umi UB sorted.bam chr1:1-2:+

Options : 
 -tag      [TAG]      Tag used for grouping reads.
 -list     [FILE]     Candidate list for -tag.
 -umi      [TAG]      UMI tag. If set, only count unique UMIs for each location.
 -bed      [BED]      Target BED region file. If the strand in column six set, only count reads with the same strand.
 -o        [FILE]     Output depth file. [stdout].
 -q        [INT]      Minimal map quality to filter. [20]
 -@        [INT]      Threads to unpack bam. [4]

Notice :
 * Require sorted and indexed BAM as input.
 * Compare with `samtools depth', PISA depth considers UMIs and strand of reads.
```

### callept

The term ‘EPT’ stands for Expressed Peak Tag. EPTs can be identified by PISA within aligned reads from RNA libraries. Once identified, the relationship between each EPT and its corresponding gene can be annotated and analyzed using the Yano package. This analysis helps in understanding the functional implications of EPTs in gene expression regulation.

The callept tool is designed to call expressed peak tags (EPTs) for indexed BAM files. The peaks are defined with UMI depth \>= cutoff.

```         
$ PISA cellept -o epts.bed sorted.bam
$ PISA cellept -tag CB -list cells.txt -umi UB -o epts.bed sorted.bam

Options :
 -tag      [TAG]      Tag used for grouping reads.
 -list     [FILE]     Candidate list for -tag.
 -umi      [TAG]      UMI tag. If set, only count unique UMIs for each location.
 -is                  Ignore strand.
 -gap      [INT]      Maximum gap to merge nearby peaks. [50]
 -min-length  [INT]   Minimum peak length. [50]
 -cutoff   [INT]      Cutoff of depth. [10]
 -o        [FILE]     Output EPTs in bed format. [stdout].
 -q        [INT]      Minimal map quality to filter. [20]
 -t        [INT]      Threads. [4]

Notice :
 * Requires sorted and indexed BAM as input.
 * Compares with `MACS2` and other peak callers, PISA callept considers UMIs and strand of reads.
 * For paired reads, strand of read 2 will be reversed to revert fragment strand.
```

### count2

PISA count generates the MEX format matrix for fragments per peak.

```         
# Count fragments per peak per cell matrix.

$ PISA count2 -bed peaks.bed -t 10 -list barcodes.txt -outdir exp fragments.tsv.gz

Options :
 -list     [FILE]     Barcode white list, used as column names at matrix. If not set, all barcodes will be count.

-name           Merge regions by bed name.

Notice :
 * This tool accepts 3 columns or 6 columns bed file(s), strand (+/-) is set in column 6.
 * By default, merging is done with respect to strandness unless -s is set.
 * -up/-down is set respect to strandness, so upstream of plus strand is downstream of minus strand.
```

### annobed

Annotate the type of region and output in a BED like file. The region type can be defined into.

```         
$ PISA annobed -gtf genes.gtf -o anno.bed in.bed

Options:
-gtf    [GTF]     GTF database.
-o      [FILE]    Output bed file.

## Deprecated commands

### parse0

Since v1.0, the old parse tool has been replaced by parse2, and renamed to parse0 for backup purposes. Due to its lower performance compared to parse, parse0 will be deleted from v2 onwards. The parse0 tool requires a configuration file to describe the library structure, including cell barcode locations, UMI locations, and tag names. Additionally, it generates various quality control reports and outputs cell barcode distributions to stdout. Below is the complete options list and a general workflow for filtering and counting reads.

```         
$ PISA parse -config read_struct.json -report fastq.csv -cbdis cell_dist.tsv \
          -1 out.fq lane1_1.fq.gz,lane02_1.fq.gz  lane1_2.fq.gz,lane2_2.fq.gz

Options :
 -1       [fastq]   Read 1 output. Default is stdout.
 -2       [fastq]   Read 2 output.
 -config  [json]    Read structure configure file in JSON format. Required.
 -run     [string]  Run code, used for different library.
 -cbdis   [FILE]    Read count per cell barcode.
 -p                 Read 1 and read 2 interleaved in the input file.
 -q       [INT]     Drop reads if average sequencing quality below this value.
 -dropN             Drop reads if N base in sequence or barcode.
 -report  [csv]     Summary report.
 -t       [INT]     Threads. [4]
```

-config requires a JSON file to tell software the locations of cell barcodes and/or UMIs. An example configured file can be found at demo/demo.json.

```         
{
    "cell barcode tag":"CB",

Here is an example to parse barcodes and reads with a predefined configure JSON file, the test files can be found at demo directory.

```         
$ PISA parse0 -config demo/demo.json -report demo/parse.csv demo/demo_1.fq.gz demo/demo_2.fq.gz > demo/demo.fq
```
